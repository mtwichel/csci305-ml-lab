Lab Questions
=======================
1. [4,2,5,2,6,10]

2. It adds 1 to each item in the int list.

3. It returns an empty list if passed an empty list; it is the base case.

4. It receives list with head cons on top; returns: adds one to head cons recursive call with the rest of list

5. False

6. Tail recursion because it first checks the current item and then recurses if need-be (due to short circuit logic)

7. { best times, it was the worst of times }

8. Tail recursion is beneficial because it does the computation before the recursive call. In this way it works much like a loop, in that it does it's work, and then sends for another call.

9. { green eggs and ham }

10. { and macaroni }

11. I love the strictness of types that ML imposes, and it overall feel. I also like that it's very orthogonal.

12. I disliked debugging code in ML. I found the errors rarely useful and without an easy print statement I found it hard to find out the state of the program at different points.

13. I overall did enjoy the lab. I like this language and it was fun implementing something bigger in it. I didn't like that pretty much all of the work couldn't be accomplished until the 4th lecture though.

14. I spent about 3 hours on the lab.

15. I hope I will use a functional language again. I think I'm going to look into Haskell, but the company I intern for uses the .NET framework so maybe F#.
